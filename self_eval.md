# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
- Pretty confident.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
- Pretty confident though I've seen some more complicated examples in other places online where I couldn't quite tell how to evaluate if something was true or false
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
- Pretty confident, but if it's a more complex one I sometimes have trouble when the order matters. Or at least making up an order in the most efficient way to evaluate the choices.
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
- Not sure actually, had some time last night so did it in a few sittings and then finished it today. Maybe 1.5hrs including the video and corrections?
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
- I feel pretty good with understanding the basics, but could use some more practice examples for honing in my speed. I probably won't adjust my calendar, but if I have extra time later will come back to this.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
- Mostly just more in depth about the order when creating the if/elsif/else statements, but I think that will come in later lessons.
